I tried to copy the game "Blobby Volley 2" in Python. I think the result got quite close to the original :)

Simply execute main.py to play the game. You can also download my game from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QQ9Va75RgKAQbAkuwdSMTKFU3WiHEf8r/view?usp=sharing.
Simply extract the folder after the download, run the .exe file and enjoy a nice round of 2 Jellos playing Volleyball against each other ;)
Player one is controlled with the W/A/D keys and player 2 is controlled by the arrow keys.

This will be part of a bigger Project where I will use different learning techniques for A.I. to learn to play the game and subsequently let the A.I.Â´s compete against each other to see which learning techniques yield the best results.


The original game can be found here: http://blobbyvolley.de/
